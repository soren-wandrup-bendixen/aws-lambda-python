export your lambda function from aws
On your linux PC:
unzip the zip file and rename the directory to your preferred name - in this case calling it auto_stop_all - it has no effect when you upload it zipped later to aws.


https://pypi.org/project/boto3/

First, install the library and set a default region:

$ pip install boto3
Next, set up credentials (in e.g. ~/.aws/credentials):

[default]
aws_access_key_id = YOUR_KEY
aws_secret_access_key = YOUR_SECRET
Then, set up a default region (in e.g. ~/.aws/config):

[default]
region=us-east-1
Then, from a Python3 interpreter:

python3
>>> import boto3
>>> s3 = boto3.resource('s3')
>>> for bucket in s3.buckets.all():
        print(bucket.name)

Place yourself in the directory (auto_stop_all) with the lambda_function.py

Once in this directory create a requirements.txt file requiring the latest version of the boto3 and botocore modules, or add the same to your existing requirements.txt:

boto3==1.9.182
botocore==1.12.182

Once this change is made, issue the command:

> pip install -r requirements.txt -t .
This command installs the boto3 and botocore correct versions and their required dependencies in the directory the command is executed within. The result is a directory such as:

If needed Change the code that calls boto3. But its not required as long as you follow this plan!

test the end result with this :

python3
import lambda_function
context = []
event = []
lambda_function.lambda_handler(event,context)
quit() 


Now in the directory with the lambda_function.py (auto_stop_all) file zip it all:
. Make sure that its not more than 10Mbyte. Otherwise it has to be uploaded into s3 first!.
When you have zipped it. Make sure that inside the zip file that there is no zip_directory. Meaning that lambda_handler.py is in the root of the zip file!
zip -r ../auto_stop_all.zip *

Now upload the zip file (auto_stop_all.zip) to aws lambda funtion

Please note its not possible to edit manually anymore. Now test it in aws gui!.

recommend also installing aws-cli

on my opensuse its:
zypper install aws-cli
