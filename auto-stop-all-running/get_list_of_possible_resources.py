# 1. not stopping dynamodb (no support for stop). You only pay for using it when you access it. But have to delete dax on it! 
# 2. Not stopping lambda, cloudwatch - would kill my self
# 3. Not stopping firehose (kinesis). Only cost money when data is ingested. So stop that instead.
# 4. Not stopping kinesisvideo. Only cost money for storing, ingesting and cosuming, not for having an active service!. 
# 5. Not stopping kinesisanalyticsv2, already getting stopped by kinesisanalytics	
# 6. Not stopping iot. Most likely iot in test will be covered by free tier
